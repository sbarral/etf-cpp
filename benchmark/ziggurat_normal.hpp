// An arbitrary precision Ziggurat implementation.
//
// This is a generic, portable and hopefuly more correct re-implementation of
// the original algorithm (Marsaglia and Tsang, 2000). It is generic over the
// RNG, the floating point type and the number of random bits W to be requested
// from the RNG.
//
// Bit width W should not be greater than that of the longest unsigned integer
// available on the platform and must be able to hold more than the 7 bits
// required by the Ziggurat algorithm to generate the table index.
//
// The RNG passed as an argument to operator() should ideally have min=0 and
// max=2^N-1 (for some arbitrary N), but min=1 and/or max=2^N-2 are tolerated.
// If the raw random numbers generated by the RNG have less than W bits, 2 or
// more raw numbers are generated, as appropriate.
//
// The main differences with the original algorithm are:
//  - a bug in the original algorithm was fixed; the original algorithm applies
//    abs() to a signed integer which is occasionally equal to the smallest
//    possible negative value, the result of which is undefined since the absolute
//    value of the smallest negative integer cannot be represented by a positive
//    value; abs() will then typically return the same _negative_ integer,
//    causing a bug in the acceptance test,
//  - it does not require integer types to have exactly 32 or 64 bits (as
//    this is not guarranteed by the C++ standard),
//  - it does not rely on casting unsigned int values to out-of-range int values
//    as a way to obtain a cheap 2-complement negative numbers, because the C
//    standard says it is not portable.
//  - both the sign and the table index are determined from the upper RNG bits
//    because many RNGs have worse quality lower bits (e.g. xorshift family
//    RNGs).
//
// The overhead in term of execution speed compared to the original seems to be
// very modest.
