# Introduction

This is the API documentation for *\<etf\>*, a C++ library that implements the
[Exclusive Top Floor](https://sbarral.github.io/etf) algorithm for very fast
random samples generation from continuous univariate distributions.

## Namespace

All public classes and functions reside within the `etf::` namespace.


## Installation, examples etc

The library is hosted at [github](https://github.com/sbarral/etf-cpp), together
with a few examples.

*\<etf\>* is a header-only library and requires no configuration: once
installed locally, it is enough to make sure that the `etf` directory is in
the include path.
