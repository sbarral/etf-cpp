## Weibull tail distribution

Outer distributions are frequently used to model infinite tails which are
exponentially bounded like for instance the tail of the normal distribution
or of the chi-squared distributions, to name a few.

Although there is obviously no general recipe to derive majorizing outer
distributions for such tails, the Weibull distribution is a surprisingly good
all-rounder for such tails which also happens to have a computationally
efficient inversion sampling implementation.

For this reason, a truncated Weibull distribution is provided in the
*\<etf\>* library as a ready-to-use outer distribution for tail majoration.
